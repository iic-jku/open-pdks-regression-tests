# Expected Failures

Cells in `layout/` that are broken on purpose, to check that a tool still catches the mistake. Every entry of `EXPECTED_FAILS` in the [Makefile](Makefile) has a section here: what is broken in the cell, and which DRC and LVS steps have to catch it.

Unlike [KNOWN_ISSUES.md](KNOWN_ISSUES.md), which shrinks as bugs get fixed, this file only grows: its entries are tests, not bugs. If a tool misses the error in one of these cells because of a bug, that step belongs in `KNOWN_FALSE_PASSES`, and the bug in `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`.

No cell is broken on purpose yet.

<!--
Template for a new cell:

## `<cell>`: <what is broken, in one line>

`EXPECTED_FAILS` entries: `<cell>:klayout-lvs`, `<cell>:magic-lvs`

What exactly is broken, which checks have to catch it, and why a correct tool can see it.
